"After that, the days just kept… passing."
 
"Sounds like a bit of a no brainer, but I guess it just goes to show how much energy I've put into that stupid bet with Eris."
 
"With that whole business behind us, all I've got is just the regular old work at Arcady. God knows there hasn't been a sudden, new customer boom."
 
"It's the same as it always was, except now time's getting all funky in all-too familiar ways."
 
"On the one hand, the hours stretch thinner and longer and stickier each passing night, like sickly sweet tachyon toffee. It's not that anything happens – it just takes forever not to."
 
"An impossible amount of tired, trite, samey-same boring irrelevant shit squeezing tighter and tighter into what the clock keeps insisting is the same amount of time."
 
"And at the same time, unless I'm paying attention, it feels like life's passing me by in a blur."
 
"I come to work in the evening, spend what feels like an age and a half waiting tables and cleaning the floor and listening to Eris' singing and wondering how much of it is recorded, then bam, it's morning, and in retrospect, all that time implodes into one instant 'nothing got done.'"
 
"I get back home feeling drained like I've done my work five times, but without the benefits of having actually {i}accomplished{/i} any of it."
 
"Either something's gone terribly wrong with some high-energy quantum whatchamacallit at the nearest university ---"
 
"--- or I'm sinking into a routine again."
 
"And much as I'm all for the cohesion of the time-space continuum, I really don't know which one I'd rather have."

Roman "There goes another night…"
 
"With my shift being over, I say goodbye to Parker, pick my jacket off of the hanger and leave through the front door, waving noncommittally to that one guy with the pink bangs who leaves big tips."
 
"The air's warm and moist outside. At this hour, the sounds of the city aren't quite muted, but dampened."
 
"About halfway back home, my knees, which have seen better days as it was, begin whining about the evening's standing around and carrying plates. Those assholes at table 6 did go a little bit nuts with those fries."
 
"If only for the sake of a change of pace, maybe, I decide to head for the nearest bus station."
 
"Minding one at the end of the street, I sit down, stretch, and glance aside at the timetable to see when the next one's arriving."
 
"Naturally, it's all dust and scratches and those annoying little white bars that tell you the one you're seeing is probably twenty years out of date and pull up your display if you want to know when the bus is coming."
 
"I reach for my pocket to take my phone out."
 
Roman "…"
 
Roman "…Huh?"
 
Roman "What the ---"
 
"Fiddling around in my pants pocket, then my jacket pocket, for a short minute produces little more than air, lint, and a ball of mush that might've once been someone's calling card Ill-fated to the laundry."
 
Roman "....Shit."
 
"Tracing my steps back to the beginning of my shift, I must've left it inside when Eris started on this one song, and I pulled it out to check which one it was and ---"
 
"Well, at least it should still be at the staff only area, if I remember correctly. I mean, Parker's probably got better things to do than steal his employees' electronics and Eris wouldn't be caught dead with any device over six-months old."
 
"Sighing deeply, I turn back towards the club."

"Parker's nowhere to be seen. Sneaky old bastard moves fast."
 
"I make my way towards the staff area, quickly spotting my phone on the table. As I'm about to leave, my eyes adjust to the dim light and my attention shifts towards a sight...as unexpected as it is unfortunately familiar."

"Sitting at the table with a strained, focused, almost desperate expression is Eris. Her shoulders are slumped uncomfortably, and from the wrinkles under her eyes one could only imagine that she's been here a while."
 
"Her lips are trembling in frustration. Her foot taps absentmindedly on the ground in an uneven pace."
 
"From the way her eyes are fixed on thin air and how she's waving her hands, this is one hell of an intense web surfing session she's doing."
 
"I pull out my phone to check. Through the display, the myriad AR windows and screen floating stilly in the air in front of her become clear."

"If nothing else, things get a lot more hectic from that day on."
 
"The first stage's easy: just a couple nights of sitting around with Eris searching the web for affordable, energy and heat efficient bits of infrastructure that we could conceivably install by ourselves to get the kind of all-around upgrade she had in mind out of this."
 
"The most tired I get around this part's my arm cramping up from having to hold up my phone at all times so I can see the AR windows she's viewing."
 
"We get around that once she asks Parker for one of those comfy chairs, with armrests, so I can sorta awkwardly place my elbow on it and only get wrist cramps, instead."
 
"At first, I'm worried we might not able to pay for some of the stuff that immediately popped to my mind once Eris started describing the sort of system overhaul she wanted, but then I found out two things:"
 
"First, it really has been a while since I've looked around those computer part catalogues. Eris might not know the first thing about how to work with them but I'll give her that: she did do her homework fine."
 
"It's kind of sickening how fast technology progresses. You have it in your mind that this one process's impossible to pull off at all without either getting a new radiator or shutting the whole system down every three hours so you won't liquify the customers."
 
"Then Eris points me to this webstore, and they got this chip that does it and only needs to be turned off for cooling every {i}two{/i} hours. Assuming we don't want to shell it out for the cryotanks, which we don't."
 
"Second: Eris actually offered to pay out of her own pocket for everything I thought was good, so I could go wild. At first I thought I'd show her for it and just order a truckload of fans or something, but, I mean, she {i}was{/i} pretty nice about it."

Roman "Seriously? Because I'm pretty sure that's not really what you mean.

Roman " --- and that way, you get to feel like the good guy in all of this, and you get to feel smug like this is all your work because you're running the show all over again. But…"


Roman "…You don't actually have a plan if I say 'no', do you? You don't have any idea what you'll do then. You'll pout and you'll call me names and you'll go on and on insinuating that you'll do this yourself and I'll stay behind, but you can't."
 
Roman "You never could, could you?"
 
Roman "So don't give me that crap, okay? I'm okay with doing all the work, and I'm even okay for doing it for you, while you sit back with all starry-eyed giving me orders."
